                    During a time when I was feeling dissatisfied in my previous career,
                    I began coding by working my way through a beginnerâ€™s book on
                    Python.

                    I knew even then I had found something I was truly passionate about.

                    Thinking my way through logical problems and developing projects to
                    expand my skills has been a truly rewarding journey.
